üßê Do you feel real in this world?
Are you real? Are people around you real?
If you can answer that with a certain YES,
I bet you never think at all.


Here are some notable quotes from *The Truman Show* that capture its themes of reality, manipulation, and the search for truth:

- **Truman Burbank**: "Good morning, and in case I don't see ya, good afternoon, good evening, and good night!" This repeated line emphasizes Truman's cheerful facade and the artificiality of his life[1][4].

- **Christof**: "We accept the reality of the world with which we're presented. It's as simple as that." This quote reflects on the nature of perception and reality, highlighting how people often accept constructed narratives[4].

- **Truman Burbank**: "Was nothing real?" This poignant question encapsulates Truman's existential crisis as he begins to question the authenticity of his life.

- **Meryl**: "You let me out, Truman. You're not right in the head. You want to destroy yourself you do it on your own." This line reveals the tension in Truman's relationships as he seeks freedom from his controlled environment.

- **Christof**: "I have given Truman the chance to lead a normal life. The world, the place you live in, is the heart to heart disease sick place. Seahaven is the way the world should be." This statement underscores Christof's justification for manipulating Truman's life, presenting Seahaven as an idealized version of reality.

- **Truman Burbank**: "Blocked at every turn. Beautifully synchronized, don't you agree?" This line illustrates the absurdity of the lengths taken to keep Truman confined within his fabricated world.

These quotes highlight the film's exploration of themes such as the nature of reality, individual freedom, and the ethical implications of surveillance and control.
